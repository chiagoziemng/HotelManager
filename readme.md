For this project, I'll be using Python 3 and the Django web framework, as well as a number of other libraries and tools to help with development, testing, and deployment.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the features I will be implementing for the front_desk:

    Guest Check-in and Check-out: The system will allow the front desk staff to check-in guests by capturing their personal information such as name, address, phone number, email address, and passport or ID details. Upon check-in, the system will generate a unique guest ID, allocate a room number, and issue a room key. The system will also allow for guest check-out, including the ability to generate an invoice and process payment.

    Room Reservations and Availability Management: The system will allow guests to make room reservations online or over the phone. The system will also provide real-time information about room availability, allowing the front desk staff to quickly and easily view room availability and reserve rooms for guests.

    Housekeeping Management: The system will provide a way for the housekeeping staff to manage room cleaning schedules, including the ability to view and update the status of each room (e.g. clean, dirty, in-progress). The system will also send alerts to the housekeeping staff when a room is vacated, allowing them to quickly and efficiently clean and prepare the room for the next guest.

    Billing and Payment Processing: The system will generate and manage invoices for guests, including room charges, additional services, and taxes. The system will also allow guests to make payments online or at the front desk, and provide an interface for the hotel to manage refunds and adjustments.

    Reporting and Analytics: The system will provide a range of reporting and analytics functionality, including the ability to generate reports on occupancy rates, revenue, guest demographics, and other key metrics. The system will also provide real-time data visualizations to help hotel management make informed decisions about their operations.
